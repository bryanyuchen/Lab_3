Initially I had hoped to create header files to complement the project and separate the WiFi functionality from the operation of the system.
However, due to a few technical issues, we ended up including all of the Lab3_WiFi.cpp file contents directly into the arduino code (hence,
the extremely long and unprofessional code in the project file). However, I decided to keep my original code here for your convenience.
